### Wallet

A wallet provides safe storage and easy access to your cryptocurrency. **Afternoon Maroon** provides a wallet and access to private keys during initial creation.

### Node

Nodes are responsible for hosting HRT’s blockchain ledger. The ledger is necessary to record transactions and provide secure mechanisms for community voting. Any member can host a copy of the ledger. Multiple nodes will distribute the trust amongst the community removing any single points of failure and bad actors.

Nodes operate independently of **Afternoon Maroon** and are governed by the rules of the HRT token network.

### Mining

HRT’s network is secured by a process called Proof of Work (PoW). PoW ensures the security and integrity of the HRT token and all transactions that take place on **Afternoon Maroon** or other market place who chooses to support HRT tokens. In short PoW is a computational heavy process that can verify and facilitate transactions by providing proof it solved a complex problem which is easily verified but difficult to forge.

Miners are compensated for this process with transaction fees and block rewards. Block rewards are given when certain conditions are met on the network.
